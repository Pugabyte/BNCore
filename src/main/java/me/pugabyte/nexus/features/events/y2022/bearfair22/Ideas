Ideas for BearFair 2022, 7th Anni
- Summer Camp Theme:
    - Remove the carnival tents and make it more like a camp feel, more woodsy i guess
    - Move theme park rides onto its own themepark themed island, replacing SDU Island
    - Would have to do something with the market place / merchants
    - What to do with rollercoaster?
- Keep Fair Theme:
    - Replace SDU island w/ a Pride Island
